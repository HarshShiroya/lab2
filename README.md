This project implements a machine learning model to classify breast cancer tumors into malignant (M) or benign (B) categories based on features extracted from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses. The Random Forest Classifier from Scikit-learn is used due to its effectiveness in handling both linear and non-linear data, and its robustness against overfitting.
